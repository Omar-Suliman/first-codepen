 <p class="intro"><em>Muhammad Ali born in Cassius Marcellus Clay
   17, January, 1942 an American professional boxer and activist.<br>He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century From early in his career.<br> Ali was known as an inspiring, controversial, and polarizing figure both inside and outside the ring.He began training as an amateur boxer when he was 12 years old.At age 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and turned professional later that year.<br>At age 22 in 1964, he won the WBA, WBC, and lineal heavyweight titles from Sonny Liston in a major upset.<br> Clay then converted to Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay, which he called his "slave name", to Muhammad Ali. He set an example of racial pride for African Americans and resistance to white domination during the Civil Rights Movement.<br>In 1966, two years after winning the heavyweight title,<br>

Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him an icon for the larger counterculture generation.</em>
    <h2><em> Early career</em></h2>
 <p class="career"> Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker.<br> From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers that included Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones and Henry Cooper.<br> Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match.These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down both by Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the predicted 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye.<br> The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963 was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number-two and -three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring (watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he might get locked up for murder). The fight was later named "Fight of the Year" by The Ring magazine

  <h4>Religion and beliefs</h4>
   <p class="rel"> Ali said that he<strong> first heard of the Nation of Islam</strong> when he was fighting in the Golden Gloves tournament in Chicago in 1959, and attended his first Nation of Islam meeting in 1961. He continued to attend meetings, although keeping his involvement hidden from the public. In 1962, Clay met Malcolm X, who soon became his spiritual and political mentor. By the time of the first Liston fight, Nation of Islam members, including Malcolm X, were visible in his entourage. This led to a story in The Miami Herald just before the fight disclosing that Clay had joined the Nation of Islam, which nearly caused the bout to be canceled.

In fact, Clay was initially refused entry to the Nation of Islam <strong>often called the Black Muslims at the time</strong> due to his boxing career. However, after he won the championship from Liston in 1964, the Nation of Islam was more receptive and agreed to publicize his membership. Shortly afterwards, Elijah Muhammad recorded a statement that Clay would be renamed Muhammad (one who is worthy of praise) Ali (most high). Around that time Ali moved to the south side of Chicago and lived in a series of houses, always near the Nation of Islam's Mosque Maryam or Elijah Muhammad's residence. He stayed in Chicago for about 12 years.
